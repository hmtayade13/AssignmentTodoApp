# AssignmentTodoApp


## Approach Taken

The ToDo Application is implemented using the following framework
1. Spring Boot
2. Spring MVC
3. Spring Security (For authorization and authentication)
4. H2 in-memory database
5. THYMELEAF

Spring Boot provided a wired frameword which easy to configure and provides a boilerplate code. I have used Spring MVC as this an online Web Application. Spring Security was used to implement the login and registration requirement in the application. This also restricts unauthorize access to web pages. Data storage is provided using the H2 java based database. The web pages/views are plain html pages along with bootstrap framework.

## Work that can be done 

1. Better Exception handling
2. Validation Checks
3. Unit testing
